# Churn Prediction
 This repository contains the Bachelor thesis project done at BTH.

 The thesis project titled "Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms on Predicting Churn within Music Streaming Service" by Lahari Gaddam and Sree Lakshmi Hiranmayee Kadali at the Blekinge Institute of Technology, focuses on developing and comparing different machine learning models to predict customer churn in music streaming services. The project is structured as a comprehensive study, submitted in partial fulfillment of a Bachelor of Computer Science degree, emphasizing both theoretical and practical components of churn prediction.

Background and Motivation:
The project begins by contextualizing the importance of churn prediction in sustaining business growth and customer satisfaction within the competitive music streaming industry. It highlights the significant financial implications associated with customer retention and the strategic advantage that effective churn prediction models can provide.

Objectives and Aims:
The primary aim is to evaluate and identify the most effective machine learning algorithm for churn prediction. This involves a systematic comparison of four supervised learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The objectives are twofold: first, to conduct a thorough literature review on recent churn prediction methodologies applied specifically to music streaming services; and second, to empirically test and compare the selected models using a dataset from KKBox, focusing on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve.

Methodology:
The methodology section details the experimental setup, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the framework used for model evaluation. This part of the thesis also discusses the rationale behind choosing the specific algorithms and the statistical techniques employed to assess their performance.

Results:
Upon implementing and testing the models, the study finds that the Random Forest algorithm outperforms others, achieving the highest accuracy and AUC score. This section presents a detailed analysis of each model's performance, supported by confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.

Conclusions and Future Work:
The thesis concludes that while Random Forest offers superior performance for this particular application, ongoing research and adaptation are necessary to maintain relevance as streaming platforms and customer behaviors evolve. The authors suggest areas for future research, including the integration of more dynamic features and the potential application of ensemble methods or deep learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.
